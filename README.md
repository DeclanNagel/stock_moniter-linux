# Stock Monitoring and Trading System

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Linux-based stock monitoring and trading simulation system. The system enables real-time tracking of stock prices, transaction simulations, and automated profit calculations. It was built to function entirely through the terminal using shell scripting, ensuring a lightweight, efficient approach. The system also includes secure user authentication, transaction history logging, and automated profit reporting, making it a fully integrated solution for simulated stock trading.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Stock Tracking**: Monitors stock prices in real-time, updating periodically.
- **Transaction Simulations**: Allows users to simulate buying and selling stocks, with simulated market conditions.
- **Profit Calculations**: Automatically calculates the profits or losses from simulated trades, providing insights into trading performance.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can access the system using login credentials.
- **Transaction History Logging**: Logs all transactions for later review and analysis.
- **Automated Profit Reporting**: Generates and stores automated reports for profit and loss on trades.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The system is deployed on a Google Cloud-hosted Linux virtual machine for persistent operation.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Linux**: The system runs entirely on Linux, leveraging the terminal and shell scripting.
- **Shell Scripting**: Used for implementing the core functionality, including stock tracking and user interactions.
- **tmux**: Utilized for persistent session management, ensuring the system continues running even after disconnection.
- **Google Cloud (VM Deployment)**: The system is deployed on a virtual machine hosted on Google Cloud, ensuring scalability and availability.

## Outcome:
The project was successfully deployed on a cloud-hosted Linux virtual machine, providing a persistent and scalable environment. tmux was used to ensure that the system remained operational even if the user disconnected. The addition of secure user authentication features enhances security, while transaction history logging and automated profit calculations ensure that trading simulations are tracked accurately. This project demonstrates strong system design and Linux proficiency, showcasing the ability to work with Linux, shell scripting, cloud deployment, and persistent session management.
